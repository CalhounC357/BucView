Web app accessible on desktop and mobile which students, prospective students, and visitors can use to tour the campus. 
The default suggested tour will be the standard ETSU tour across all the main buildings. 
Specialized tours should also be supported where someone interested in a specific college can focus on what they offer. 
Additionally, tours specific to a department should be available.
Non-academic tours will be offered around the history, art, and flora of the campus. 
The tours are self-guided or virtual, with the user reporting to the web app that they've reached the next location, 
and the app providing information about their location. 
Additional points of interest between two tour locations will be listed within the web app.
