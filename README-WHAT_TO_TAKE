The only few things need from this for the main build is the Images folder which contains all the logos, the <img> tags from index.html if you need reference.
The favicon named etsu.ico for the icon that shows in top left of each page tab, and the line of code that activates it for use. 
Everything is found under wwwroot.

Optional:
  the CSS style code for the page which can be found in css also under wwwroot
